# FIT: Data Science Department - Fall 2025 Cohort

Welcome to the Data Science Department! Our mission is to provide members with practical, hands-on experience by taking a complete data science project from conception to conclusion. This semester, you will work in a team to tackle a real-world dataset, uncover meaningful insights, and present your findings in a professional poster session.

This program is designed for anyone with curiosity and a willingness to learn, regardless of your starting skill level. We provide the roadmap; you provide the drive.

## How It Works

Our program is structured in two distinct phases. This model ensures that everyone has the foundational skills needed to contribute effectively to a team project.

-   **Phase 1: Onboarding & Competency Check (2 Weeks)**
    -   You will work through a self-paced learning module to master the essential tools for data analysis. This phase concludes with **"Project 0,"** a standardized competency check that serves as your gateway to joining a project team.

-   **Phase 2: Project Execution & Poster Session (8 Weeks)**
    -   After successfully completing Project 0, you will be designated a **Project Analyst**. You'll join a small team, select a project, and spend the rest of the semester conducting research and analysis with mentorship from department leadership. The program culminates in our end-of-semester Poster Session.
